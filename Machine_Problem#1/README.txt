There are two folders. One notebook files and one Py files. I have submitted both types
of files for easier grading. 

The CV2 file only uses CV2 library for saving and showing the images. 
The other Matplot file uses Matplot to show the images which might be more convenient. 


To compile the program correctly the image files have to be in the same folder
as the program itself. 

The Matplot_MP#1 program would be simpler to open in notebook.
To run in Terminal just type:
'''
python3 CV2_MP#1.py OR python3 Matplot_MP#1.py
'''

The result would show up in different files as they are calculated. 
For CV2_MP#1 just press 'space' key to skip to the next image. For Matplot_MP#1
just close the file and the next one will show up automatically.
