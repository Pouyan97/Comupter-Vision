To compile the program correctly the image files have to be in the same folder
as the program itself. The Matplot_MP#1 program would be simpler to open in notebook.
To run in Terminal just type:
'''
python3 CV2_MP#1.py OR python3 Matplot_MP#1.py
'''

The result would show up in different files as they are calculated. 
For CV2_MP#1 just press 'space' key to skip to the next image. For Matplot_MP#1
just close the file and the next one will show up automatically.
